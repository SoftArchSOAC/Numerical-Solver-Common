# Numerical-Solver-Common
This is the common java code that is used by the family of Numerical-Solver apps.

There are more than one version of Numerical Solver App (For eg. Engineering Physics Numerical Solver, Mechanical Engineering Numerical Solver, etc.)
Hence this common code aims to centralize the solving logic, database connectivity, etc. and can be integrated when implementing.

Note: It is work in progress, yet currently under main production line. When implementing, it will go through major changes.
